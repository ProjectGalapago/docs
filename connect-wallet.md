# Connect Wallet

## Install a Web3 wallet on your devices&#x20;

Project Galapago works on the Algorand blockchain, to interact with the site you will need a Web3 wallet that supports Algorand. If your cryptocurrency is stored on a centralized exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance, and others), it does not count as a Web3 wallet, and will not work.&#x20;

### Connect your Web3 wallet&#x20;

You can easily find the “Connect wallet” button on the landing page.
